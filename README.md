# Final Capstone 3
In this Capstone the goal of the project is to create a model that can predict the stock price of amazon stock. [Capstone 3 Final Report](Capstone3_FinalReport.pdf) contains a summary of the project. 
## Data
Data was gathered fro yahoo finnancial as well as the US department of treasury. The data was gathered, and cleaned.
This can be found [capstone3_datawrangling](capstone3_datawrangling.ipynb)
## EDA
Priliminary analysis is done with the data in the file [Capstone_3_EDA](Capstone_3_EDA.ipynb)
## Modeling
[Capstone_3_preprocessing_and_modeling](Capstone_3_preprocessing_and_modeling.ipynb) has the preprocessing, splitting and 
training of the data, The fitting of the models and the results.
## Modeling Results
A comperative analysis between the different models, determination of the best models and analysis of important features can
be found in [Capstone_3_modeling_results](Capstone_3_modeling_results.ipynb)
A model with an accuracy in the 99.64% percentile was created.
